### Executive Summary

The purpose of this project is to investigate the London Airbnb market in order to help Airbnb hosts maximise their income and improve their ratings.

Data is taken from http://insideairbnb.com, an independent data prrovider for Airbnb.  

Airbnb is an online marketplace for people who want to rent their property for lodging, primarily homestays, or tourism experiences. This project aims to help: Airbnb hosts to increase their income through improving the potential factors that influence the rent price; people who want to become Airbnb hosts and need to estimate the rent price of their property.

After creating the model we found that the following parameters affect the most the rent price:
Certains neighbourhoods like Westminster, Chelsea and the City of London will have a bigger positive influence on the price.
The ‘Private room’ type will decrease the price more than ‘Home/Apartment type.
The number of guests a property can accommodate will increase the price.
The number of bedrooms will increase the price as well.
